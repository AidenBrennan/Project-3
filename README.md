## Project Description:

the COFFEE MARKET intends to provide coffee enthusiast a virtual place to explore different coffees; and the convinence of purchasing all they need to brew the perfect cup at home. 


## Motivation:

Coffee has a rich history and cultural connection; which over the many different generations continue to be shared and loved. For this reason, we continue to see the steady demand and trend for coffee. 

To help facilitate the demand for coffee to our current and next generation of computer savy culture; we have created this web application, which we intend to expand in the future to make it more than just a place to purchase your favourite coffee.

We would like to create a virtual place where coffee enthusiast can come to explore different coffee, order and purchase different coffee products from around the worid, and barista equipment.
